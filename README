- For some reason the python getopt is not parsing the options correctly in some cases. Considering changing to optparse even if it is  more complicated to manage. 

TODO:

- Look in to doing Zone Walks using DS records, can not figure out how to properly do the query with dnspython.
- Provide option to filter for wildcard return IP when doing a dictionary name brute force.
- Append to the end of found hosts thru bruteforce the numbers from 1 to 9 and 01 to 09.
- Append to dictionary hostname of hosts found thru reverse lookup.
